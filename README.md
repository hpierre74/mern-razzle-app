# MERN RAZZLE APP
Razzle React-Express SSR project with Mongoose API implementation.

## Project Idea

### Provide a Booking API for developers

Sometimes developing a feature just require a few ajax calls if you find an API that fits your needs.

In a Booking API scenario, what you often need is to include a Booking Module in a Restaurant App.
Assuming you'll need to integrate it more than once, you might appreciate not to refactor and reconfigure each API for each client.
This is solved easily using a Booking API as an external service, accessing your data over HTTP requests, using Ajax in your client code.

#### Not ready yet (!)

*Hosting the default app*
The default app will provide a Register/Login UI
Each User will be able to create Restaurants instances.
Each Restaurant instance has a dedicated path to access his Bookings.
Each Restaurant has configuration rules to fill on creation (opening hours, availability, lastminute...)


## TODO

#### 1/ Abstract Bookings in Restaurant Module
#### 2/ Create User Auth-Security 
#### 3/ Create Rules API
#### 4/ Create UI
#### *5/ Provide differents (React, Vue, Angular) Booking Module clients ?*
